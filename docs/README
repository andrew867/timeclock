PURPOSE:

PHP Timeclock is a web-based application that is designed to replace manual punchclocks or
timeclocks to keep up with employees' work hours. In a very basic sense, it can replace 
sign-in/sign-out sheets that many companies use to track where their employees are at any
given point of the day.

Reports can be generated to simply list employees' time, or to tally up employees' time
for a designated period.

The main page displays all the latest punch-in/out activity for each user, and can be configured 
to display only a certain office or group, and/or only the current day's activity.


LATEST ENHANCEMENTS:

NONE, this is a bug fix release. These fixes are detailed in the CHANGELOG included in this release.


Let's move along to the INSTALL file.
