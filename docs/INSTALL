TESTED:

--- PHP 4.34, 5.1.2 with mysql support
--- MySQL 3.23.49, 4.0.17, 5.0.18
--- Apache 1.3.22, 1.3.29, 2.2.0
--- Firefox 1.0 - 1.5.0.4, Firefox 1.0 Preview Release, IE 6.0 SP1, IE 6.0 SP2 for XP, IE 7.0 beta 2

Any version of mysql or webserver software that supports php, whether it's an earlier 
version than what's tested or later, will probably work fine. Any web browser that supports

Beginning with version 0.9.4, an option has been provided to display punch-in/out times 
according to the timezone of the connecting client system. The client must enable cookies and 
javascript in their web browser in order to take advantage of this option.

INSTALLATION:

New Install
-----------
--- Unpack the distribution into your webserver's document root directory. 
--- Create a database named "timeclock" or whatever you wish to name it.
--- Create a mysql user named "timeclock" (or whatever you wish to name it) with a password.
    Give this user at least SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER, and CREATE privileges to ONLY 
    this database.
--- Import the tables using the create_tables.sql script included in this distribution.
--- Edit config.inc.php.
--- Open index.php with your web browser.
--- Click on the Administration link on the right side of the page. Input "admin" (without the quotes) 
    for the username and "admin" (without the quotes) for the password. Please change the password 
    for this admin user after the initial setup of PHP Timeclock is complete.
--- Create at least one office by clicking on the Create Office link on the left side of the page. 
    You MUST create an office to achieve the desired results. Create more offices if needed.
--- Create at least one group by clicking on the Create Group link on the left side of the page. 
    You MUST create a group to achieve the desired results. Create more groups if needed.
--- Add your users by clicking on the Create New Users link, and assign them to the office(s) and
    group(s) you created above. Give Sys Admin level access for users who will administrate 
    PHP Timeclock. Give Time Admin level access for users who will need to edit users' time, but 
    who will not need Sys Admin level access. If you require the reports to be secured so only 
    certain users can run them, then give these users reports level access. 

    *** Admin level access and reports level access are completely separate from each other. Just 
    *** because a user has admin level access does not give that user reports level access. You must 
    *** specifically give them reports level access when you are creating or editing the users, 
    *** if you choose to secure these reports for these users. To make PHP Timeclock lock down the 
    *** reports to only these users, set the use_reports_password setting in config.inc.php to "yes".


Upgrading from 1.02 or 1.03
---------------------------
--- Backup and move your current installation.
--- Unpack the distribution into your webserver's document root directory. 
--- Edit config.inc.php or simply replace the new config.inc.php with your previous config.inc.php.


Upgrading from 1.01 or 1.0
--------------------------
--- Backup and move your current installation.
--- Unpack the distribution into your webserver's document root directory. 
--- Edit config.inc.php.
--- Either login to PHP Timeclock and run the Upgrade Database script within the Admin section, or
    upgrade the database by running the queries that are contained in the alter_tables.sql script.


Upgrading from 0.9.4 or 0.9.4-1
-------------------------------
--- Backup and move your current installation.
--- Unpack the distribution into your webserver's document root directory. 
--- Upgrade the database by running the queries that are contained in the 
    alter_tables.sql script included in this distribution against the PHP Timeclock
    database. The Upgrade Database link in the Administration section of PHP Timeclock will 
    not work for this particular upgrade since the admin user needs to be added to the database 
    initially. Meaning, you cannot even get to the Upgrade Database page until the admin user 
    is added to the database.
--- Edit config.inc.php.
--- Open index.php with your web browser.
--- Click on the Administration link on the right side of the page. Input "admin" (without the quotes) 
    for the username and "admin" (without the quotes) for the password. Please change the password 
    for this admin user after the initial setup of PHP Timeclock is complete.
--- Create at least one office by clicking on the Create Office link on the left side of the page. 
    You MUST create an office to achieve the desired results. Create more offices if needed.
--- Create at least one group by clicking on the Create Group link on the left side of the page. 
    You MUST create a group to achieve the desired results. Create more groups if needed.
--- Edit your users by clicking on the User Summary link, then click on their username, and then 
    assign them to the office(s) and group(s) you created above. Give Sys Admin level access for 
    users who will administrate PHP Timeclock. Give Time Admin level access for users who will 
    need to edit users' time, but who will not need Sys Admin level access. If you require the
    reports to be secured so only certain users can run them, then give these users reports
    level access. 

    *** Admin level access and reports level access are completely separate from each other. Just 
    *** because a user has admin level access does not give that user reports level access. You must 
    *** specifically give them reports level access when you are creating or editing the users, 
    *** if you choose to secure these reports for these users. To make PHP Timeclock lock down the 
    *** reports to only these users, set the use_reports_password setting in config.inc.php to "yes".


Upgrading from releases prior to 0.9.4 
--------------------------------------
--- The best way to upgrade from versions prior to 0.9.4 is to download version 0.9.4
    and upgrade to that version first. Then follow the upgrade instructions included
    in that version of the distribution. 

    The reason for doing it this way is that the timestamps are stored differently for versions
    0.9.4 and higher than in previous versions. Upgrading to 0.9.4 first will preserve the 
    punch-in/out history for each user.
