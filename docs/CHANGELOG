1.03  6/20/06
-----------------------
--- Fixed a bug in the Audit Log report where incorrect dates and times were 
    being displayed. (Thanks to Brett Moss for finding this bug.)
--- Fixed a bug in the Total Hours report where incorrect dates were being
    displayed. (Thanks to Brett Moss for finding this bug.)
--- Fixed numerous other bugs in the Total Hours report. (Thanks to Brett Moss
    for finding these bugs.)


1.02  6/5/06
-----------------------
--- Fixed numerous bugs in the Edit Time page concerning European style dates.
    The times would not always be edited if $calendar_style = "euro" in
    config.inc.php.
--- Fixed a bug in the Delete Time page concerning European style dates. The times
    would not always delete if $calendar_style = "euro" in config.inc.php.
--- Fixed a bug in the Add Time page concerning European style dates. The time
    would not always add if $calendar_style = "euro" in config.inc.php. And if by
    chance it DID add, it would not add it for the day specified.
--- Fixed a bug in the Change Password and Create User pages concerning the eregi
    functions included within those pages. On some installs, this error
    message would appear while attempting to change passwords or create users: 
    "Warning: eregi(): Invalid content of \{\}". (Thanks to Jim Blansett for 
    finding this bug.)
--- Fixed bugs in the Total Hours and Daily Time reports concerning European 
    style dates. The reports would not display the expected correct results if 
    $calendar_style = "euro" in config.inc.php.
--- Fixed a bug in the Upgrade Database page. If magic_quotes_runtime was turned
    on in php.ini, the script would tell you that your mysql user did not have
    the appropriate privileges to the PHP Timeclock database, even if the user 
    did.
--- Fixed a bug where if the "Remember Me" checkbox is checked on the main page 
    and output_buffering is set to "Off" in php.ini, a php error would display
    and the "Remember Me" functionality would not work.
--- Added a 'disabled' property to the employees table, this allows for users
    to be marked as disabled instead of deleting them entirely from the 
    database.
--- Added the ability to track a user's ip address when they sign-in/out, and to
    therefore report on it. This ip information is available for each report.
    There are two variables in config.inc.php dealing with this. One is to 
    turn on ip_logging, and the other is a default setting for the reports if 
    ip_logging is turned on. (Thanks for the idea Jason Mortensen.)
--- Added a report entitled "Audit Log". This report details each addition, 
    deletion, or edit of a person's time. It does NOT display the individual
    punch-ins/outs that are performed via the main page, but it does display the
    details of all additions, deletions, and edits of a person's time for a
    given date range when it's done via the Add/Edit/Delete Time pages.
--- Added the ability to allow only certain networks or ip addresses to connect
    to PHP Timeclock. (Thanks for the idea Jim Blansett.)
--- Added the option to utilize table prefixes within PHP Timeclock. This can 
    be helpful if you have an existing mysql database that you would like to 
    use with this app. (Thanks for the idea Fred.)
--- Added an option to export the reports in csv format.
--- Removed the Admin user from the dropdown on the main page and from 
    displaying it's punch-in/out details on the main page. This user should not
    be punching-in/out anyways. Also removed it from the dropdowns for the 
    reports (except for the Audit Log), and from displaying it's punch-in/out 
    details in the reports.
--- Added the "Notes" column heading in the Time Report as it was mistakenly
    omitted in prior releases.
--- Removed the Email Address column from the User Summary and User Search (just
    the results on this page) pages. To view or change a person's email address, 
    simply click on their username or the edit icon that corresponds with their 
    username.

1.01  3/23/06
-----------------------
--- Fixed the Hours Worked report so it would calculate the correct number of hours 
    worked. The hours were not always correct if a user was currently punched in.
--- Fixed a bug where if there was a multiple of 40 names listed on the front page, the
    footer would not correctly align to the right of the page.
--- Fixed a bug where if $display_current_users = "yes", $display_office = "all", and 
    $display_group = "all" in config.inc.php, the main page of the application would 
    unexpectantly print out the last query that was run, then exit and die.
--- Fixed a bug on the Edit Office page where if there were identical group names that
    were affiliated with different parent offices, the number of users displayed for 
    one of these groups for the current office being edited would not be correct.
--- Fixed the Edit System Settings page to display distinct groups in the display_group
    dropdown box if there were multiple groups with the same groupname in the database.
    This would only happen if display_office was set to "all", and groups with the same 
    groupname, but affiliated with different officenames, existed in the database.
--- Added report_start_time and report_end_time variables for the Hours Worked report.
    These variables have been added if the report needs to be run from a certain start 
    time on the starting day of the report to a certain end time on the ending day of 
    the report. These are configurable in config.inc.php.
--- Provided the option to print the Display Names on the reports, also configurable in
    config.inc.php. 
--- Provided the option to view a triple dropdown consisting of Offices, Groups, and 
    Usernames, or a single dropdown consisting of Usernames when setting the paramaters
    of the report for ALL reports.
--- The currently logged in username is now displayed in the top left of each page just
    under the logo. (Thanks for the idea Jason Mortensen.)
--- Added a 'Remember Me?' option to the main page of the app that automatically 
    selects the last username that logged in from a particular computer. This is done
    via a cookie, so cookies must be enabled within the user's browser for this to 
    work as expected. (Thanks for the idea Jason Mortensen.)
--- Took out the code in display.php that had anything to do with timerpt.php, and 
    stuffed that code into timerpt.php.
--- Replaced the transparent pngs provided by Mark James with updated, compressed 
    transparent pngs from Mark James.

1.0  3/6/06
-----------------------
--- Added a report to tally a user's hours. This was done with a little help from Adam
    Woodbeck. He was nice enough to provide a working report he had written, so we 
    utilized some of his code to create this report.
--- Added the ability to display times in 24-hour format.
--- Added the ability to display dates in many various formats.
--- Added a way to logout of the admin section. Had to change the way the admin user
    logged on, seeing as how there is no way to TRUELY logout when using http-auth, or
    even login at all if php is running in cgi mode. Sessions are now being utilized for 
    logging in and out of the admin and reporting sections.
--- Added a way to edit user properties. 
--- Added pages to allow for adding, deleting, and editing of punch-in/out statuses.
--- Allowed for the ability for more than one login to have administrative access.
    Authentication is performed via mysql now, instead of a plaintext name and password
    in config.inc.php. $admin_username and $admin_password have been removed from 
    config.inc.php.
--- Allowed for the ability for more than one login to have access to ONLY add, edit, or 
    delete a user's time. This is a separate permission that any user can be given.
    If a user has Time Admin access, it does not mean that user will have Sys Admin 
    permission or access to the reports. It simply means that the specified user has 
    permission to add, edit, or delete a user's time.
--- Allowed for the ability for more than one login to have reporting access.
    Authentication is performed via mysql now, instead of a plaintext name and password
    in config.inc.php. $reports_username and $reports_password have been removed from 
    config.inc.php.
--- Each user can now be assigned as a Sys Admin user, Time Admin user, and/or a reports 
    user. Just because a user has admin access does not mean that user can view the 
    reports. In order for a user to have access to the reports, you must give them that 
    access via the admin section or globally set $use_reports_password to "no" within
    config.inc.php.
--- Added some property fields to the usernames. Now when creating or editing a username,
    the following user properties are required: Username, Display Name, Email Address, 
    Office, and Group. The email address field is currently not used for anything in this
    release, but it will be utilized in a future release in some way.
--- Added a User Search page, for if you have many users and wish to find the properties
    of a user without scrolling through the entire user list.
--- Added Offices to which each username in the database MUST be a member of.
--- Added Groups, which are also mandatory for a user to be a member of, that are 
    subcategories of the Offices. Basically, think of Groups as being departments of a 
    company, and Offices as being the different office locations of a company. If you 
    have only one office location within your company, you might want to setup only 
    one office. And the same goes for Groups.
--- Added the option to display punch-in/out times for only users of a certain office,
    or office/group combination on the main page.
--- Added the ability to add or delete an individual punch-in/out time.
--- All statuses are now determined to be either "in" or "out" in the database. This makes
    for more useful reporting.
--- Added a page to display the current options (system settings) configured within 
    config.inc.php.
--- Added a page where you can edit the current options (system settings) within 
    config.inc.php. 
--- Added a printer friendly page for the main page. If you need to print out the current
    listing on the main page, simply click on the link titled "printer friendly page" in 
    the top right of the main page, then print it.
--- The Upgrade Database page within the admin section has been improved, and should
    work more reliably in most environments.
--- Fixed the reports so they now paginate correctly when printed from web browsers that 
    are not Internet Explorer. In previous releases, the reports paginated ONLY if your 
    browser was IE.
--- Added a few nice little icons provided by Mark James from 
    http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/.
--- Added a couple of javascript scripts provided by Matt Kruse from http://mattkruse.com.
    One is a color picker so a color can be given for individual punch-in/out statuses, 
    and the other one is a calendar popup which is utilized in several places within this
    app.
--- Added a javascript script provided by Joshua Paine from 
    http://demo.fairsky.us/javascript/png.html It renders the transparent pngs (provided 
    by Mark James) for Internet Explorer versions 6 and below.
--- Added a number of security fixes throughout thie app.
--- Performed general code cleanup on a number of files.


0.9.4-1	5/27/05
-----------------------
--- Fixed a bug in the time report - if the "To" and "From" dates were the same, 
    either no punch-in/out times would display, or just some of the times would display.
--- Fixed a bug in displaying the punch-in/out times on the main page if 
    $show_current_users_only was set to "yes" in config.inc.php. Either none of the 
    times would display, or just some of the times would display.
--- This bug was also found when attempting to change a user's time.
--- Added "This script also makes other minor changes to the database." to the database
    upgrade script description in dbupgrade.php.


0.9.4	5/24/05
-----------------------
--- Required the use of at least version 4.1.0 of PHP. This was done to move from the
    use of long PHP predefined variable arrays ($HTTP_*_VARS) to PHP superglobal
    variable arrays ($_*), which were introduced in PHP 4.1.0. With PHP5's ability
    to disable the ($HTTP_*_VARS) arrays using 'register_long_arrays=Off' in php.ini,
    i felt it was time to make the switch everywhere in the code.  
--- Changed the way time was being stored in the database from a mysql timestamp to a 
    unix timestamp. This provides the ability to utilize timezone functionalities
    and quite possibly other functions for future use.
--- Added a database upgrade script within the app, dbupgrade.php. You can now 
    choose to upgrade the database via the command line using the mysql statments
    included in upgrade_database.sql (as you could have always done), or go to the 
    administration section of the app and choose to upgrade the db from there. FOR
    THIS RELEASE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE UPGRADE SCRIPT, dbupgrade.php. This is 
    because of the need to convert all of your current mysql timestamps into unix 
    timestamps. Yes, you CAN do this without the script, but the script also takes 
    into account the timezone of the server so the new unix timestamps will be stored
    in GMT.
--- Added the ability to display punch-in/out times in 3 different ways:
    1) times can now be displayed according to the end user's timezone. This is done
       with the use of javascript and the addition of a cookie to the user's system.
    2) times can be displayed according to the web server's timezone. This is the way
       times in all previous versions of the distribution have been displayed (it is
       also the default setting of this release).
    3) times will be displayed in GMT if neither of the two above options are chosen.
    This is set in config.inc.php.
--- Added an option to display current, local weather stats. This is done with code 
    from the PHP Weather project by Martin Geisler and others. PHP Weather is 
    licensed under the GPL.  
--- When printing the main page or the time report, the date and time it is run is 
    reflected according to how you chose to display your punch-in/out times via 
    config.inc.php, instead of just assuming you want to use the timezone of the 
    webserver. This affects ONLY the printouts of these pages.
--- Removed the $time_entry_title variable in config.inc.php and stuffed it into 
    timereport.php. All this variable did was provide an easy way to change the time 
    report title.
--- Removed the $left_side_width variable in config.inc.php. This variable set the width
    for the left side of each page. The value for this variable has now been hard-coded 
    into leftmain.php.
--- Combined leftmain.php and timeclack.php into one file, leftmain.php.
--- Fixed a bug where the wrong time and date were being reported in an error message
    when a user's time was changed.
--- Performed general code cleanup on a number of files.


0.9.3	3/21/05   
-----------------------
--- Added the ability to change a user's time entry in the administration section.
--- When notes are included in a user's time entry, they are input into the database in 
    all lowercase, instead of just being displayed on the screen as lowercase. They were
    being strung to lowercase on the screen after they were entered into the database, 
    but they are now instead initially input into the database as lowercase. This is almost
    not worth mentioning, but it is a minor change, thus it's here in the changelog. 
--- Renamed the Employee Report to Time Report, and added the option to run this report
    for all usernames. Doing this negated the need for having the Monthly Report,
    Today's Report, and Date Report. These reports have been removed. 
--- Moved the Timeclock Admin link to from the left side of the page to the far right 
    part of the topbar and renamed it to Administration.
--- Combined topmain.php and topmain_alt.php into one file, and removed topmain_alt.php.
--- Fixed a formatting problem on the home page and the reports where the rows of data were  
    a couple of spaces more to the left than the column headings. Fixing this also fixed an
    odd bug where if you refreshed the home page repeatedly, the rows of data would 
    sometimes be extremely out of line with the column headings.
--- Added some security to all form fields by disallowing certain characters to be used 
    when filling in the form fields.
--- Limited the size of the form fields to match the size of the corresponding fields in 
    the database.
--- Removed the $fqdn option in config.inc.php as it was pretty much a useless option
    anyway. It was a variable to provide a fully qualified domain name for the path to the 
    distribution files.
--- Removed the $move_reports option in config.inc.php and replaced it with 
    $use_reports_password, an option to require a username and password to view the 
    reports.
--- Added a username and password option in config.inc.php to give some users the ability 
    to view the reports, but not access anything else in the admin section. These variables are
    set in config.inc.php with the $reports_username and $reports_password variables. This 
    is not the best way to allow authentication when accessing the reports, but it is one 
    of the easiest. Another way of accomplishing the same goal is adding a 'groups' field
    in the db and assigning everyone to a group and requiring authentication via the users'
    username and password. I don't care to do it that way just yet.
--- Added the ability to display only the current day's activity on the front page instead
    of the last entry from each user. This is done with the $show_current_users_only 
    option in config.inc.php.


0.9.2   11/15/04
-----------------------
--- Fixed timeclack.php so a php information message wouldn't occur if $use_passwd was set 
    to "no" in config.inc.php.
--- Added the option to move all reports to the administration section. If $move_reports
    is set to "yes" in config.inc.php, then the reports are moved to the administration
    section of the app.
--- Moved the $use_passwd, $admin_username, $admin_passwd options in config.inc.php
    from the 'required changes' section to the 'optional changes' section.
--- Removed the $website and $domain_name variables in config.inc.php. These were variables
    for your website link and name in the bottom left of each page. They were removed for 
    aesthetic reasons.
--- Added the word 'New' to the 'Password(s)' column heading in chngpasswd.php. The heading 
    now reads 'New Password(s)' instead of 'Password(s)'.
--- Fixed the 'Notes' column on all pages to align more to the left instead of centering 
    itself in the middle of the column. 
--- Added better printing functionality for IE (Internet Explorer 4.x and higher) via css 
    for the reports. The reports still print unter Mozilla/Firefox, they're just not
    formatted as nicely with the column headings on each page.


0.9.1-1	10/31/04
-----------------------
--- Fixed a bug where headers were sometimes being sent twice.


0.9.1	10/26/04
-----------------------
--- Added the option to use passwords for submitting an employee's status.
    The php crypt() function is used for this. Unfortunately, doing it this way forces
    you to add users with passwords and/or change passwords using ONLY this app or some
    other php script using the crypt() function. Adding passwords directly into the 
    mysql database will not work. This option is set in config.inc.php with the 
    $use_passwd variable.
--- Added a field named 'employee_password' to the employees table. If "none" is chosen
    for $use_passwd in config.inc.php, then this field is ignored.
--- Added a password blank in leftmain.php if $use_passwd = "yes" in config.inc.php.
--- Added a Timeclock Administration section which contains scripts to add/delete users
    and to change users' passwords. This section is password protected.
--- Added an admin username and password for the Timeclock Administration section. These
    variables are set in config.inc.php with the $admin_username and $admin_password
    variables. 
--- Added the option to change the width of leftmain.php (the section where you sign-in).
    This is added only to make the width easier to change, in case you have a few 
    usernames that are so long that they're wider than the current setting. 
    This option is set in config.inc.php with the $left_side_width variable.
--- Removed the $index variable in config.inc.php. This was a variable for your index
    page. It provided no extra functionality unless you wanted to have a different
    index page.
--- Changed the default example links for the $links variable in config.inc.php to 
    all point to slashdot.org. They were pointing to http://111/, http://222/, up to 
    http://666/.
--- Combined daterptinfo.php and daterpt.php into one page, did the same for employeerpt.php
    and employeerptinfo.php, currmonthrpt.php and currmonthrptinfo.php, todayrpt.php and
    todayrptinfo.php, current_status.php and timeclock.php.
--- Removed alink and avisited classes from default.css, as they were not being used 
    anywhere in the code anyway.
--- Rewrote the code so it wouldn't matter if register_globals or magic_quotes_gpc are 
    enabled/disabled in your php.ini.
