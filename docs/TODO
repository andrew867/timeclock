PHP Timeclock
Copyright (C) 2006 Ken Papizan <pappyzan_at_users.sourceforge.net>


TODO:

--- Create an option dealing with emailing reports. Maybe allow all reports to be emailed to 
    a specific email address or multiple email addresses. Maybe even allow each user's reports
    to be emailed to his/her self. There are many different ways to go with this. Maybe 
    consider using CRON on unix systems and AT on windows systems to help with an automatic
    scheduling for this. Any ideas you might have concerning this option are welcomed.
--- Create an option to allow each user to add/edit/delete their OWN time, but no one 
    else's. Currently a user must have Admin privileges in order to do this.
--- Offer php timeclock in as many different languages as possible. Help in translating the app
    to ANY language will be appreciated. If you contacted me earlier regarding this, please
    feel free to contact me again.
--- Add an option to export the reports in pdf format.
--- Create some sort of install script that will make new installs a little easier.


ADDED FROM TODO IN v1.02, 6/5/06:

--- Add a 'disabled' property to all users. This would give you the ability to take the username
    out of the list of available names to punch-in/out without having to delete the user in
    order to do so.
--- Add an option to export the reports in csv format.


ADDED FROM TODO IN v1.0, 3/6/06:

--- Tally the hours in a report showing the total number of hours per requested period.
--- Add a location/dept option that displays on the main page what location/dept a user 
    is a member of.
--- Make the css code work for nicer printing out of Mozilla/Firefox.


ADDED FROM TODO IN v0.9.4, 5/24/05:

--- Add current weather info for your region in the left side of each page beneath submit
    button.


ADDED FROM TODO IN v0.9.3, 3/21/05:

--- Add the ability for the admin to change a clock in/out time for a user. This way, if
    someone forgets to sign in or signs in too late, the admin can change it.
--- Add the option to allow a 'reports' user access to the reports in the admin section,
    but not access anything else in the admin section.
--- Add an option to allow the ability to show only the status of current users for only the
    current day. 


ADDED FROM TODO IN v0.9.2, 11/15/04:

--- Add more CSS for better looking printing (IE for sure, maybe/maybe not Opera).
--- Add the option to only allow the admin access to view the reports. If you choose to 
    only allow the admin access, then the reports will be moved to the admin section.


ADDED FROM TODO IN v0.9.1, 10/26/04:

--- Add a security option where users would need to input their password when changing 
    their status. This would be accomplished by adding a password field to the employees
    table. You would have the option to turn it on or off.
--- Create a script to make adding/deleting users easier.
