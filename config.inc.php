/* Choose the way dates are displayed. DO NOT EDIT THESE DATE VARIABLES MANUALLY UNLESS YOU
   KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Instead, change these date variables via the Edit System Settings
   page in the Administration section of PHP Timeclock (sysedit.php). $datefmt default is
   "n/j/y", $js_datefmt default is "M/d/yy", $tmp_datefmt default is "m/d/yy", and
   $calendar_style default is "amer". You will need to choose date formats with matching
   numbers, ie: if format number 10 is used for $datefmt, then format number 10 will need to
   be used for $js_format and $tmp_format as well. "euro" will need to be chosen for date
   format numbers 1-6, and "amer" will need to be chosen for date format numbers 7-12.
   Again, if you are confused, i urge you to change these settings via the Edit System
   Settings page in the Administration Section. Choosing mismatched options will lead to
   much confusion and plenty of headaches later.

   Possibilities for these variables are:

   $calendar_style --> 1) amer
                       2) euro

   $datefmt --> 1) j.n.Y       $js_datefmt --> 1) d.M.yyyy       $tmp_datefmt --> 1) d.m.yyyy

                4) j.n.y                       4) d.M.yy                          4) d.m.yy
