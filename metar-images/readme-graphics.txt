readme.txt for the Icon set for AJAX conditions, trends and wind direction arrows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind arrows are from Ken True at Saratoga-weather.org

Feel free to replace them with any .gif set of 16 direction arrows with size of 
height="14", width="14" transparent background GIFs.

The trend arrows with transparent background are from Johnny at http://www.wetlaufer.com/wx/

The conditions Icons are from Larry (anole) at http://weather.anolecomputer.com/ from his excellent
PHP Weather Sticker script and are used with his permission.

Note:  if you merge this icon set into a different directory, be sure to change the setting

var imagedir = './ajax-images';  // place for wind arrows, rising/falling arrows, etc.

assignment in the ajaxWDwx.js script to point to the new directory relative to the current page and
without a trailing '/'.  Failure to set this correctly will result in broken images for wind, trend and
current summary icon.
